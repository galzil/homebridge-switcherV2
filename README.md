## Getting the Parameters:

* To get the switcherIP, phone_id, device_id and device_pass you will need to follow @NightRang3r instructions at:
https://github.com/NightRang3r/Switcher-V2-Python

You'll need to use his library first (one wat or another) to extract these parameters.

* To get your Python Path, you'll need to figure where the Node Modules lib is located.
Execute the following command to get the path:
```
echo $(npm -g ls --depth=0| head -n1)/node_modules/homebridge-switcherV2/switcherJSON.py
```


## Credits:

@NightRang3r - the switcherJSON.py script in this repository is based on his. I have modified his library to fit this plugin. I could not make it work without it!!
